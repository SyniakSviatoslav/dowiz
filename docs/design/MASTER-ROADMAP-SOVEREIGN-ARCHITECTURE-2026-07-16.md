# MASTER ROADMAP — Sovereign Architecture (dowiz + openbebop), 2026-07-16

> **Single source of truth for the TARGET:** `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md` §0 (MESH-FOUNDATION +
> SCOPE RULE) + §8 (honest gaps), cross-locked with `docs/design/STRATEGIC-VECTORS-LOCKED-2026-07-16.md`.
> **Single source of truth for the PATH:** this document + `sovereign-roadmap-2026-07-16/R2-MERGED-PHASE-ROADMAP.md`
> (detailed reference table) + 19 per-phase blueprints in the same directory (execution detail).
>
> This document does not restate the architecture — it maps the shortest honest path from the
> repo's ACTUAL current state to that architecture, in full, with zero anchors deferred outside a
> phase and zero pre/post-MVP split, per the operator's 2026-07-16 directive. It supersedes
> `MASTER-ROADMAP-10-PHASES-2026-07-14.md`, `MASTER-EXECUTION-PLAN-2026-07-13.md`,
> `MASTER-INTEGRATION-PLAN-2026-07-14.md`, and `MASTER-ROADMAP-MVP-2026-07-12.md` (root) — all
> pre-date the mesh-foundation pivot (`0d1935d96`) and are kept as history, not law, per
> `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s own "merge, never append" rule. It does **not** edit `ARCHITECTURE.md` itself;
> `BLUEPRINT-P02` is the proposed merge-diff, left for the operator.

## 0. Provenance — how this was built (so the result can be checked, not just trusted)

Following the operator's routing directive (Fable for synthesis grounded in code + research +
target architecture; Opus for blueprints), this roadmap was produced in three rounds, all
code-grounded, none self-certified without evidence:

1. **Round 1 — five parallel Fable gap-analyses**, each owning a disjoint slice of the 147 nominal
   architecture anchors (M1-12, V1-6, D1-8, S1-9, E1-62, F1-50), each grounded directly in the
   actual code (`/root/bebop-repo` for mesh/PQ-crypto, `/root/dowiz/kernel`+`engine` for
   service/compute, `/root/hermes-agent-kernel-rewrite` for dev-tooling routing), not just prior
   docs. Reports: `sovereign-roadmap-2026-07-16/R1-{A,B,C,D,E}-*.md`.
2. **Round 2 — one Fable merge pass** that resolved cross-cluster dependencies the five reports
   surfaced into each other into ONE dependency-ordered phase sequence, re-verifying every
   load-bearing claim (CI job list, LICENSE text, D5/D8 absence, E10/E36 duplication) against the
   live tree rather than trusting R1's paraphrase. Report: `sovereign-roadmap-2026-07-16/R2-MERGED-PHASE-ROADMAP.md`.
3. **Round 3 — nineteen parallel Opus blueprints**, one per phase from Round 2's table, each a
   concrete, file-and-line-grounded design document (files touched, migration steps, falsifiable
   acceptance criteria) — not implementation. Reports: `sovereign-roadmap-2026-07-16/BLUEPRINT-P{01..19}-*.md`.

Total: 5 + 1 + 19 = 25 agent passes, all read-only research/design (no product code, CI config, or
canon file was edited by this effort — every finding below is a proposal for the operator or a
future implementation pass to act on).

---

## 1. What is actually true right now (headline findings, most load-bearing first)

These surfaced independently across multiple phases' code-grounded research and materially change
what "the roadmap" means — read this before the phase table:

1. **The PQ-crypto substrate is far more built than canon implies, but unconsumed.** `cargo test`
   across all five bebop2 crates is GREEN today (232+ tests). ML-DSA-65 is ACVP-verified. But it's
   a library nobody calls: dowiz has **zero** code-level dependency on the protocol (one stray
   comment at `kernel/src/domain.rs:524`), the wire is authenticated-but-**plaintext-readable**
   (`NoopPayloadEnc`, default feature literally named `insecure-tls`), and the trust root itself is
   classically forgeable (`roster.rs` delegation chain is Ed25519-only, making the ML-DSA leg
   vacuous against the exact quantum attacker it exists to stop). → Phases 3, 9.
2. **`apps/web`, `packages/ui` (all i18n), and `packages/domain` are fully deleted**, not merely
   decoupled (`79ef316f6`/`db766de47`/`fce5738b0`; `git ls-files 'apps/*'` = 0 at HEAD and on
   `origin/main`). Every "re-plumb the product onto the mesh" framing in older docs is stale — this
   is a rebuild, with the As-Built Summary and DOWIZ-INTERFACES checklist as the feature-inventory
   ledger. → Phase 16.
3. **CI is regressed, silently.** A gitleaks gate existed (`b10a7bfe3`) and was dropped when
   `f9ab28ff1` rewired CI to drop all JS/TS. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` today runs exactly 2 jobs;
   kernel's 337 tests and engine's 47 tests run **nowhere** in CI. Every downstream "GREEN" claim
   in this repo has been unverifiable since that commit. `CONTRIBUTING.md:17` additionally makes a
   false claim (a DCO check that doesn't exist). → Phase 1, correctly sequenced as the global
   Wave-0 precondition for trusting anything downstream.
4. **The one mandated global control doesn't exist, and the thing that shares its name is its
   opposite.** M9 requires a unilateral operator kill-switch; the only "KillSwitch"-named
   construct in the codebase (`guard.rs`) is a ≥2/3 **consensus** vote registry — a governance
   mechanism, not a kill-switch, and architecturally the inverse of what M9 specifies. → Phase 10.
5. **V1 (split-identity + adversarial verification) is 0% built while its entire substrate sits
   idle.** All "verification" today is self-context (the same session that made a change judges
   it) — this is the self-certification pattern BRAIN-TOPOLOGY research already flagged as this
   project's dominant failure mode. The ML-DSA/hybrid-gate/genesis-loader primitives V1 needs are
   already finished. → Phase 6.
6. **Canon itself is stale in three checkable ways**, independent of any roadmap work: (a) LICENSE
   is **already AGPLv3** (flipped `ac1caba40`, 2026-07-14) — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 still claims an
   Apache-2.0 mismatch; (b) the force-push/history-scrub question is **substantively resolved**
   (H8 runbook closed, origin already at the scrubbed tip) — canon still lists it as open; (c) the
   count "**147 locked anchors**" is off by at least 2 — **D5 and D8 are referenced in the "D1-8"
   total but defined nowhere** in any revision of either canon document (verified by git
   archaeology across all four introducing/amending commits). None of these are edited here —
   `BLUEPRINT-P02` is the proposed merge-diff. → Phase 2.
7. **A real, still-open HIGH-severity finding survives from the prior crypto pass**: the `mod_l`
   constant-time side-channel (C4b, flagged 2026-07-14, never closed) sits on the same Ed25519
   code path that Phase 6's identity ceremony and Phase 10's kill-switch signing would both use —
   this is why Phase 3 (crypto hardening) gates both of them, not just wire work.
8. **Two real design contradictions block dispute/escrow (F44)**, not a missing spec: the only
   existing design (`fable-protocol-2026-07-11/F2-dispute-arbitration.md`, a complete 6-state
   machine with a written RED test) proposes a reputation-scoring jury (contradicts M12's
   NO-COURIER-SCORING law) and UMA/Kleros external arbitration (contradicts M6's zero-dependency
   law). This needs an explicit operator ruling, not a silent pick. → Phase 2 (ruling), Phase 14 (build).

**No pre/post-MVP split exists in this table.** Every phase is a real build-dependency step toward
the same one architecture; "later" phases are later because something earlier must exist first
(crypto before wire, wire before hub-runtime, hub-runtime + money before the product rides the
protocol), never because a phase was deemed optional or deferred by preference.

### Waves (maximum parallelism)

```
WAVE 0 (start immediately, mutually independent): P1 P2 P3 P4 P5
WAVE 1: P6◄(1,3)   P7◄(1)        P8◄(1)         P18-prep◄(1,2)
WAVE 2: P9◄(3,4)              P11◄(1,8)       P12◄(7)
WAVE 3: P10◄(3,6,9)
WAVE 4: P13◄(4,7,9,10)
WAVE 5: P14◄(2,13)   P15◄(10,5,9)   P16◄(4,13)
WAVE 6: P19◄(18)                              P17◄(11,16,+GPU-unlock)
```

**Critical path: P3 → P9 → P10 → P13 → {P14, P16} → P17** (crypto correctness → confidential wire
→ hub runtime → delivery spine → dispute/UI → demo). P1 and P2 gate everything *epistemically*
(nothing downstream is trustworthy without them) but are cheap and fully parallel — start them
first regardless of what else is picked up. P5, P8, P11, P12, and P18-prep are off-critical-path
lanes that should be fanned out early to use idle capacity.

Full adjacency list: `R2-MERGED-PHASE-ROADMAP.md` §3.

## 3. Operator decisions required (19 items) — the real gate on Wave 3+

This roadmap intentionally does **not** resolve these. Each lives inside a numbered phase (that IS
its coverage — an anchor blocked on a ruling is not a dropped anchor), but real engineering on
several critical-path phases cannot proceed with full confidence past Phase 2 without them. Full
Descartes-quadrant treatment (options, tradeoffs, a flagged-overridable recommendation where one is
safe to offer) is in `BLUEPRINT-P02`. Highest-leverage first:

| # | Decision | Blocks | Stakes |
|---|---|---|---|
| O3 | **F44 dispute/escrow mechanism** — the only spec contradicts M12 (NO-COURIER-SCORING) and M6 (zero-dep) | Phase 14 | Not silently resolvable; candidates exist (operator-gated arbiter capability; staked Schelling voting) |
| O4 | **F48 merge semantics** — content-address-only vs. CRDT for per-hub graph sync | Phase 14 | A dormant `crdt-fence` guard was found to fence CRDT out of money/order code ONLY — genuinely open for the knowledge-wiki |
| O1 | **D5/D8** — define (candidates found in root `DECISIONS.md`, but on a *colliding* numbering scheme — adopting them accepts the collision explicitly) or renumber the whole D-series | Every "147"/"146" claim | Affects every anchor-count statement in every doc, including this one |
| O5 | **D2/iroh** — land the crate for real, or amend canon to "quinn primary + named unlock trigger" | Phase 9 | iroh does not exist in the codebase today; canon currently claims otherwise |
| O7 | **E1/F41 "hub-ring"** — ratify the consistent-hash reading (a literal star-hub would contradict M7 no-SPOF) | Phase 13 | Two words with no formal spec anywhere until ratified |
| O19 | **I-FINAL proof home** — bebop consensus path vs. dowiz `tools/eqc`; the file the old blueprint cited doesn't exist at either candidate location (it exists at a third, legacy path) | Phase 13 (F46 full closure) | Sharper than originally scoped — see BLUEPRINT-P13 |
| O9 | **V1-B verifier isolation bar** — fresh worktree vs. separate machine vs. different model family | Phase 6 | One sentence of canon closes this |
| O8 | **F10 max sub-hub recursion depth** | Phase 15 | Numeric value only |
| O2, O6, O10-O18 | Cheap/mechanical: E10≡E36 ratification, E35 "3-tier locality" definition, S7/S8 split, M12/F25 replay bound, "BD" expansion, M9 subtree-kill semantics, E13-20 numbering, canon rewordings, EUTM brand choice, public-flip go, GPU-unlock (external) | Bookkeeping / Phases 8,9,10,14,15,18 | `BLUEPRINT-P02` offers a recommended default for each — operator can accept or override |

**Practical read:** Waves 0-2 (Phases 1-5, 7, 8, 11, 12) need **no operator input** to start — pure
engineering against already-diagnosed gaps. Wave 3 onward (Phases 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15) benefit
from or hard-require O1, O3-O9 being ruled on. Getting O1/O3/O4/O5/O7/O9 answered early is the
single highest-leverage non-engineering action available — it unblocks the entire critical path's
back half without costing any engineering time.

---

## 4. Anchor accounting — zero exceptions, proven not asserted

- Nominal canon count: **147** (M1-12 + V1-6 + D1-8 + S1-9 + E1-62 + F1-50).
- **E10 ≡ E36** — identical text ("ML-DSA hybrid") at two different anchor numbers, re-verified
  against `STRATEGIC-VECTORS-LOCKED-2026-07-16.md:89,98`. Counted once; E36 recorded as alias. → 146.
- **D5, D8 undefined** in every revision of both canon documents (git-archaeology-verified across
  all four introducing/amending commits, independently re-checked in Round 2). Carried as
  **operator-decision placeholders inside Phase 2** — that is their coverage, not a gap in this
  roadmap. → **146 distinct IDs: 144 defined + 2 placeholders**, all 147 nominal IDs accounted for.
- **One seam anchor** (E16, "spectral+BD memory") was not claimed by any of the five Round-1
  clusters; the merge pass assigned it explicitly to Phase 14 rather than let it drop silently.
- Full per-anchor → phase mapping (all ~147 IDs, one row per series): `R2-MERGED-PHASE-ROADMAP.md` §5.

**Zero anchors deferred outside a phase. Zero anchors silently dropped.** This claim is checkable,
not asserted — the accounting table it rests on is reproducible by grep against the two canon
documents plus the phase table above.

---

## 5. What this roadmap is not

- **Not an implementation.** Every one of the 19 blueprints is explicitly a planning document —
  none of the 25 research/design passes that produced this roadmap wrote or edited product code,
  CI config, or canon files. Turning a blueprint into a merged diff is the next, separate unit of
  work per phase.
- **Not a canon edit.** The corrections in §1 items 6-7 and the full decision docket in §3 are
  proposals (concretely, `BLUEPRINT-P02`'s diff) for the operator to merge into `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  by hand or by explicit delegation — this document does not touch that file, honoring its own
  "merge, never append" rule.
- **Not a re-prioritization of the architecture.** No anchor was judged more or less important than
  another; phase ORDER here reflects only build-dependency reality (what must exist before what),
  never a value judgment about which parts of the architecture matter more.

## 6. Next steps

1. Operator rules on O1, O3, O4, O5, O7, O9 (the ones that actually gate engineering, per §3) —
   everything else in the decision docket has a safe default already proposed in `BLUEPRINT-P02`.
2. Wave 0 (Phases 1-5) starts immediately — no ruling required, each is independently actionable
   from its blueprint today.
3. `BLUEPRINT-P02`'s canon-diff gets merged into `ARCHITECTURE.md` (the LICENSE/scrub/DCO
   corrections in particular are cheap, checkable, and currently make the canon assert three false
   things).
4. As each phase's implementation lands, its blueprint's falsifiable done-test is the closure
   criterion — not a subjective "looks done."
